## 1min computer club music

While we were circling and discussing Greg's(?) proposal to each submit a 1-minute clip of something to present their musical persona to the group, I had a certain clip of a YouTube vid in mind of a VR performance in the Just Intonation environment I'm building. Instead, here's a couple condensed clips of me fiddling with some kalimbas recently attached to a piano soundboard. They are sped up at different rates. Tuning of the kalimbas is all by ear, tuned to the piano soundboard, seeking out lo-fi sounding acoustic resonances and one excitable string brushing against its peg.

I invite you to experiment with playback rate as you work with this clip. It loops OK and slowing it down a lot brings out some primeval bone dances.
